# NextAuth Onboarding Status Refactor - Completed

## Overview

This refactor centralizes onboarding status information in the user's JWT and session, eliminating redundant API calls and streamlining middleware logic. Instead of making API calls to check onboarding status on every page load, we now store this information directly in the JWT token.

## Changes Made

1. **Updated Auth System:**
   - Modified `lib/auth.ts` to fetch onboarding status during JWT token creation
   - Added `onboardingCompleted` and `onboardingRedirectTo` to JWT and session
   - Updated `lib/types.ts` to include these new fields in the `CustomUser` interface

2. **Simplified Middleware:**
   - Removed all fetch calls to `/api/job-seeker/check-onboarding` from middleware
   - Replaced complex logic with a simple boolean check using `onboardingCompleted` from session
   - Maintained path redirections using `onboardingRedirectTo` from session

3. **Added Auth Session Refresh Helpers:**
   - Added `refreshAuthSession()` in `lib/auth-utils.ts` to refresh JWT after onboarding completion
   - Created a React hook `useRefreshSession()` in `lib/hooks/useRefreshSession.ts` for client components
   - Created an example `OnboardingSubmitButton` component showing usage pattern

## Migration Status

âœ… **Migration Complete**

The migration has been successfully completed:
- All users now have onboarding status in their JWT tokens
- Temporary migration scripts and endpoints have been removed
- New documentation has been added in `ONBOARDING-JWT.md`

## Benefits

- **Reduced API Calls:** No more redundant API calls on every page load
- **Improved Performance:** Faster page transitions without onboarding check API calls
- **Centralized Logic:** Onboarding status logic centralized in one place
- **Better Error Handling:** More robust error handling with fallbacks for auth and session

## Ongoing Best Practices

1. **Refreshing Sessions After Status Changes:**
   - Always call `refreshAuthSession()` after updating a user's onboarding status
   - Use the `useRefreshSession()` hook in client components

2. **Monitoring:**
   - Monitor for any unexpected behavior in edge cases
   - Watch for proper redirection based on onboarding status

3. **Legacy API Endpoints:**
   - The onboarding check API endpoints (`/api/job-seeker/check-onboarding`) can remain for backward compatibility
   - Consider deprecating them in the future as they're no longer needed by the core application
