# Onboarding System Implementation

This document provides an overview of the onboarding system implementation for the Temu-v2 application.

## Database Schema

We've implemented a comprehensive database schema for the onboarding process using Drizzle ORM with PostgreSQL. The schema includes the following tables:

- `userProfiles`: Stores basic user information
- `userAddresses`: Stores user address information
- `userSocialMedia`: Stores user social media links
- `userPengalamanKerja`: Stores user work experience
- `userPendidikan`: Stores user education history
- `userKeahlian`: Stores user skills
- `userSertifikasi`: Stores user certifications
- `userBahasa`: Stores user language proficiency

## API Endpoints

We've implemented the following API endpoints:

1. `/api/onboarding`: For saving and retrieving onboarding data
   - `POST`: Saves onboarding data for a specific step
   - `GET`: Retrieves all onboarding data for the current user

2. `/api/upload`: For handling file uploads
   - `POST`: Generates a presigned URL for uploading files to S3

## Frontend Components

We've implemented the following frontend components:

1. `OnboardingLayout`: The main layout for the onboarding process
2. `ProgressBar`: Shows the progress of the onboarding process
3. `OnboardingFormActions`: Common UI component for form actions (back, next, submit)
4. `InformasiPribadiForm`: Form for collecting personal information
5. `BahasaForm`: Form for collecting language proficiencies
6. `RingkasanProfil`: Component for displaying a summary of the user's profile

## Hooks

We've implemented the following custom hooks:

1. `useFileUpload`: For handling file uploads
2. `useOnboardingApi`: For handling API calls to the onboarding endpoints

## Pages

We've implemented the following pages:

1. `/onboarding`: Main onboarding page that redirects to the first step
2. `/onboarding/informasi-pribadi`: First step for collecting personal information
3. `/onboarding/bahasa`: Step for collecting language proficiencies
4. `/onboarding/ringkasan`: Final step for reviewing all information
5. `/onboarding/success`: Success page shown after completing the onboarding process

## Next Steps

To complete the implementation, the following steps are needed:

1. Implement the remaining form components for each step in the onboarding process:
   - `/onboarding/informasi-tambahan`
   - `/onboarding/alamat`
   - `/onboarding/social-media`
   - `/onboarding/level-pengalaman`
   - `/onboarding/pengalaman-kerja`
   - `/onboarding/pendidikan`
   - `/onboarding/keahlian`
   - `/onboarding/sertifikasi`

2. Install required dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install @aws-sdk/client-s3 @aws-sdk/s3-request-presigner
   ```

3. Set up environment variables for AWS S3:
   ```
   AWS_REGION=your-region
   AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your-access-key
   AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your-secret-key
   AWS_S3_BUCKET_NAME=your-bucket-name
   ```

4. Implement authentication if not already done.

5. Test the entire onboarding flow to ensure data is properly saved and retrieved.

## Usage

To use the onboarding system:

1. Ensure the user is authenticated
2. Navigate to `/onboarding` to start the process
3. Complete each step of the form
4. After completing all steps, the user will be redirected to the success page and then to the dashboard

## Implementation Notes

- The onboarding process is designed to be step-by-step, allowing users to save their progress and continue later
- Form validation is implemented at both the frontend and backend levels
- File uploads are handled securely using presigned URLs for direct upload to S3
- The database schema is designed to be flexible and extensible for future requirements
